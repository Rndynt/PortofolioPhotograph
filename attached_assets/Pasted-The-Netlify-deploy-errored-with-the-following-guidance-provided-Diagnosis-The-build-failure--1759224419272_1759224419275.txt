The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is occurring because the build script is unable to find the `vite` command, resulting in a non-zero exit code.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure that the `vite` package is listed in the `devDependencies` of the `package.json` file in your repository.
2. If `vite` is missing, add it to the `devDependencies` by running:
   ```bash
   npm install vite --save-dev
   ```
3. Once `vite` is added, redeploy your site to see if the issue is resolved.
